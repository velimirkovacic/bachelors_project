# Project R

A group project that took place during my final year of undergraduate study at [Fakultet elektrotehnike i raƒçunarstva](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/). 

Each of the four team members was asigned one of the four finalist quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms from NIST's [competition](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms). Each was to make a program to use either the algorithm's encryption or digital signature to test whether they work and write accompanying documentation.

## CRYSTALS-Dilithium
This repository contains a program for testing CRYSTALS-Dilithium digital signature and encryption and accompanying documentation.
